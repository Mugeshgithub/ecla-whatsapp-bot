# ECLA Community Services WhatsApp Bot - Complete System Model

## 🏠 **Overview: "Hey Neighbour!" Community Service Matching**

The ECLA WhatsApp bot is a smart community service matching system that connects ECLA students for mutual help. It solves the problem of lost requests in group chats by providing direct, intelligent matching.

---

## 🎯 **Core Purpose**

**Problem Solved:** Many requests for help (laundry, IT help, airport pickup, etc.) get lost in the ECLA WhatsApp group.

**Solution:** A smart bot that matches service providers with service seekers, creating direct connections.

---

## 🔄 **How It Works - Step by Step**

### **1. User Registration Flow**
```
User sends "hi" → Bot welcomes → User provides name → Choose role → Register services/location
```

**Two Types of Users:**
- **Service Provider** 🛠️ - People who want to help others
- **Service Seeker** 🤝 - People who need help

### **2. Service Matching Flow**
```
User needs help → Bot finds matches → Shows 3 options → User chooses → Direct chat connection
```

---

## 💡 **Real ECLA Examples**

### **Service Requests That Work:**
- 🚗 "Hey I need someone to lend a car"
- ✈️ "I want someone to pickup/drop to airport"
- 🍕 "I need food delivery to pickup"
- 🧺 "I need laundry help"
- 💻 "I need IT help"
- 🇫🇷 "I need French translation for prefecture"
- 🛒 "I need shopping assistance"
- 📦 "I need help moving boxes"
- 🚬 "I need a cig" 😄
